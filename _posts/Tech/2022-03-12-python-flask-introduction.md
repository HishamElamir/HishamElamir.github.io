In this part of the series, you will learn about the different parts of a Flask application. You will
also write and run the first Flask web application.


## Introdiction

Flask is a small framework by most standards‚Äîsmall enough to be called a ‚Äúmicroframework,‚Äù 
and small enough that once you become familiar with it, you will likely
be able to read and understand all of its source code.

But being small does not mean that it does less than other frameworks. 
Flask was designed as an extensible framework from the ground up; 
it provides a solid core with the basic services, while extensions provide the rest. 
Because you can pick and choose the extension packages that you want, 
you end up with a lean stack that has no bloat and does exactly what you need.

And in this series, we will go from the basics of how to install and work with flask, 
to building applications that serve some purposes. 
Stay tuned for the next parts of the series and hope that will get interesting through time üòã.
